##Tarot Reader Logic Assessment##

**Read the logic assessment and respond to the questions below.**

**Bookis had had a splitting headache for days. He had tried everything he could think of to get some relief and nothing was working. He asked his mother for advice. She said, “go visit the tarot card reader on 15th and he’ll know just the cure.” Bookis was skeptical but desperate, so he decided to give it a shot. Upon entering the store, the tarot card reader said, “You’ve got a headache. I’ve got a potion to cure you, but you’ll have to guess the weights of my three prized cats (in whole kilograms).”**

**Bookis said he was game, but that he needed a hint. The tarot card reader said, “If you multiply the weight of each, you get 36.”**

**Bookis thought for a moment and said, “I need another hint.” The tarot card reader said, “If you add their weights, it's the same as the price of a tarot reading.” The tarot reader pointed at the board behind the counter with the price list.**

**Bookis looked up at the board and said, “Okay, I see the price, but I still don’t have enough information to answer definitively - can you give me just one more hint?” The tarot reader said, “I can’t give you a hint, but Sammy, my littlest kitty, really seems to like you!” The cat chewed on Bookis’s sleeve. At that point, Bookis exclaimed “I know the weights of your cats!”**

**Bookis told the tarot reader the weights, got his headache potion (which worked immediately), and pet Sammy’s head before leaving.**

***
**1. What were the weights of the cats?**

The cats weigh 1kg, 6kg, and 6kg.

**2. How did you arrive at that answer? Show your process.**

I knew that the cats' weights multiplied together equalled 36 and all numbers were whole numbers. So I knew I needed factors of 36, which gave me the following options:  
1 * 2 * 18  
1 * 3 * 12  
1 * 4 * 9  
1 * 6 * 6  
2 * 2 * 9  
2 * 3 * 6  
3 * 3 * 4  

The tarot reader also told Bookis that the cats' weights added together equalled the price of a reading. We don't know the price of a reading, but we know that this hint didn't give Bookis a single definitive answer. From this we can conclude that there are at least two possible weight combinations that, when added up, come to the same total. This means that the only possible solutions are 1 * 6 * 6 and 2 * 2 * 9. Both of those number groupings, when added up, equal 13.

But I also knew that Sammy is the reader's "littlest kitty," not "one of the littlest kitties." That meant the smallest number had to be unique, so I dismissed 2 * 2 * 9 and determined that the answer must be 1 * 6 * 6.


**3. What other possible answers are there?**

Assuming the tarot reader only has three cats, there is no other possible solution. If, however, the reader has many cats but only prizes three of them, her "littlest kitty" may not be one of her prized cats and the answer of 2 * 2 * 9 would still work. Bookis took a little risk there, but to be fair, he was in a lot of pain.
